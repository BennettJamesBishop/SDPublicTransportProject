### Sandy Toes: SDTS San Diego Transit Simulation

The goal of this data science simulation project is to optimize the San Diego transit system. To achieve this goal, we will use various datasets, including but not limited to transit schedules, ridership data, and population data. We will apply machine learning and statistical models to analyze this data and uncover patterns and insights.
